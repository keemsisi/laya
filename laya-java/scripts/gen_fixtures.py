"""Generate the parity fixtures `laya-java` asserts against, by running the real `laya`.

Nothing in `laya-java` may hand-write an expectation that this script can produce. A port's
tokenizer, its sequence budgets and its decode arithmetic all drift silently, and a hand-typed
expectation drifts with them; a generated one cannot. `sdk/typescript/scripts/sync_presets.py`
sets the same precedent for the TypeScript client's presets, including the `--check` gate CI runs.

    gen_fixtures.py             # write laya-java/fixtures/*.json
    gen_fixtures.py --check     # exit 1 if any committed fixture would change

`--check` is what CI runs: it regenerates into memory and diffs, so a change to `laya/` that moves
the contract fails the Java build instead of being discovered by a user.

Phase 0 families (no model weights needed -- these are the tables and the text the model is shown):

  lang_tables.json    every table `laya/lang.py` routes on, and every threshold constant
  presets.json        the preset question dicts, verbatim, as the model receives them

      * `str.isspace()`, which `Character.isWhitespace` disagrees with on four code points, two of
        them the no-break spaces a pasted ticket is full of;
      * `round(x, 4)` and `round(x)`, both of which are half-to-EVEN on the exact binary value;
      * dict insertion order, which decides the script profile's order and every tie between two
        languages with the same score;
      * and the structured-state scans, where a long English stack trace must not outvote a short
        foreign message, and a name field must not pull an English ticket off the English model.

    Each case records the full output of `state_text`, `detect_script`, `script_profile`,
    `latin_profile`, `analyse` and `is_english`. String cases also record every internal helper,

    differently on Linux than on macOS and CI reported the committed copy as stale. Every value is
    now produced by an exact route -- a decimal literal (correctly rounded by strtod), IEEE
